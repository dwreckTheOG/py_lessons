## Python Casting
### Specify a variable type
Casting in python is done using constructor functions like:
* int() -used to construct an integer.
* float() -used to construct a floating point number.
* str() -used to construct a string or character.

## Python Strings
### Single line strings
Single line strings in python are either sorrounded by single or double quotation marks
### Multiline strings
Multiline strings are sorrounded by six single or double quotes
### Strings are Array
Strings in python are arrays of characters.
however python does not have a character data type, so a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.
Square brackets can be used to access elements of the strings.
### Looping a string
You can loop a string of character in python using for loop.
### String Length
You can get the length of a string using the len() function
### Chek String
To check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use the keyword in.
### Check if NOT
To check if a certain phrase or character is NOT present in a string, we can use the keyword not in.
